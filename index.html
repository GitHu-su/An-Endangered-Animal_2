            <h1> Armadillo's Basic Information</h1>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>Armadillos are known for their armored bodies and their ability to curl up into tight balls to defend themselves from predators.
                </b></li>
                    
                <li class="even-row">They are fast diggers with pointy snouts and long tongues that allow them to search for insects underground. Their bellies are the most vulnerable part of their bodies.With a preference for warmer areas, armadillos tend to live in habitats near the equator, originally in South America. However, a small number of the family do now live in North America.
                </li>
                <li> There are 21 species of armadillo and all of them are still present in South America, with 11 species residing in Paraguay.
                </li> 
                <li>Armadillos live in grasslands and forests and are selective when it comes to where they will build their burrows. Sands and loose soils make digging and foraging much easier. They are timid creatures and will often retreat to their burrows when they feel threatened.
                </li>
