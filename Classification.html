                    Nature makes many odd creatures, but one of the strangest on earth must be the armadillo. This animal looks like it’s wearing a suit of armor, and its name means “little armored one.” Some people think armadillos are amphibians or reptiles, but they’re not. They’re mammals.

                    What Is a Mammal?
                    Backbone: Every mammal is a vertebrate, which is an animal with a backbone. Other animals have backbones, but they don’t meet the other criteria for mammals.

                <td background="img/bgtable.jpg">
                    Fur or hair: All mammals have fur or hair on their skin. Some marine mammals have no hair, but they meet the other requirements to be mammals.

                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="img/armadillo.jpg 4.jpg"height="100"width="100px"> 
                </td>
               <td background="img/bgtable.jpg">
                Sweat glands: Mammals are the only animals that sweat. The ability to sweat helps mammals regulate their body temperature. Some marine mammals don’t have sweat glands because they live in the ocean.

                Live young: Only mammals give birth to live young. They also nurse their young. Monotremes are the only exception to this rule. They’re mammals who lay eggs but also nurse their young.

                Occipital condyles: This is the scientific name for two bony knobs at the base of an animal’s skull. Only mammals have them. Reptiles and fish have a single knob on their skull.

                Now, let's see how an armadillo compares to that list.
